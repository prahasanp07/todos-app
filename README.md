Welcome <name>!
The product owner has decided to add a new todos feature to our application. We need your help creating the todos page and navigating to it.

In our first iteration of todos, we only need the ability for a user to create todos, mark them as complete and delete them. We won't need to worry about editting todos this sprint, but doing so would be quite impressive! 😀

To help hit the ground running this sprint, a junior developer on the team already created the raw HTML and CSS for you to use 🙏🙏🙏.

This file is located in the directory: /src/scratch/todos.

Acceptance Criteria

Add your name to the HTML of this page <h1>Welcome!</h1>. This template can be found at: /app/welcome/welcome.component.html.

Your name should render at the top of this page. ⬆

Create the TodosComponent.

This can be done by right-clicking on the app directory and selecting Angular Generator > Component from the contextual menu.

URL for the Todos page should be: /todos.
Place a link for user's to navigate to /todos in the template of the HeaderComponent.
Create a resuable component that can be used to render an individual todo.
As a user I should be able to create a todo by entering the name of a todo in the form at the top of the page.
Upon submitting the form, the input field value should be cleared out.
Upon submitting the form, a new todo should render in the list below.
As a user I should be able to mark a todo as complete and visually see a checkmark when the todo is complete and a circle when incomplete.
As a user I should be able to delete a todo from the todos list by clicking on the trashcan icon.
When there aren't any todos in the list, I should see the text "There aren't any todos. Why don't you create one?".
The text "create one" should be a hyperlink, that when clicked will place focus on the form field to create a new todo.
